Dimensioning the data
---------------------

* 128 lines/image may be enough at first - at 16 imgs/s thats 2048 lines/s
    * That's 488us per line
* (15.77 cm x 2) / (154000 cm/s) = 204.805 us - that's 1024 pts at 5MHz
        * That's 204.805 us per line
        * That's 283.5 us of idle time
* Final image is therefore 128*1024 px
        *  1024 pts for 15.77cm is 6.49px / mm
        * That's 2.1Msps on average

-   TLDR
    -   CapTech Workshop. Was great!
    -   Acted upon a split between a FPGA long-term approach, and a
        non-FPGA one. I remembered those good old times when this was
        a possibility.
    -   Damn it. What if I could dig into this? Not ÂµC, rather an
        extension for an existing computer.. or mini computer.
    -   Saw some ideas on the Arduino's side. Separate ADC.

    -   How to use it?
        -   http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/05/22/bbb--working-with-the-pru-icssprussv2
        -   For low-speed comms, conventional I2C or similar protocols
            can be used, and there is no need to use a PRU. For
            high-speed comms the PRU may be extremely useful because it
            can service the hardware with no interruptions due to Linux
            context switching, and no overhead is experienced by the
            main ARM processor. Here are some examples that should be
            feasible; basically quite a few possibilities, such as
            **interfacing to a fast ADC (e.g. analog capture)**,
    -   https://theembeddedkitchen.net/beaglelogic-building-a-logic-analyzer-with-the-prus-part-1/449
        BBB is a 100MHz logic analyzer on a BeagleBoneBlack
    -   Demo over the http://beaglelogic.github.io/webapp/
    -   http://r.git.net/beagleboard/2013-10/msg00204.html
        -   Can the PRU be used to interface the Beaglebone to external
            ADC? I need to capture 500 micro-seconds of data at a 5
            MHz rate.
        -   -&gt; *It depends on the interface to the ADC. There is a
            parallel capture interface that will easily run that fast,
            and you may be able to use the bit-shift interface to do
            serial or something like SPI if the PRU's capability lines
            up with what your ADC wants to see.*
    -   http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui
        -   *In its current state, it grabs analog data from an ADC, and
            dumps it into memory on the BBB, ready to be displayed or
            further processed. It could be used for gathering analog
            information from sensors, CCDs or other data
            acquisition use-cases. To be reasonably useful, the desire
            was for it to support 20Mbytes/sec of data or more. It does
            achieve this, but it is for further study to find higher
            speed methods.*
        -   *This is not such a bad idea, because in future the ADC
            could be swapped out to a (say) 10-bit ADC with no code
            change on the PRU.*
        -   **Once the data has been captured (2000 samples in this
            example), the command byte is acknowledged, so that the
            Linux hosted application can know that the PRU
            has completed. The PRU now sits and waits for a new
            instruction from the Linux hosted application.** -&gt; works
            for us - fixed depth = fixed \# of samples
    -   Buffer to be used : detailed at
        http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui
        -   ''These were extremely important for two reasons. One reason
            is that the pins to the BBB that I wished to use need to be
            isolated during power-up, because they are used for
            selecting the boot method. If there was any unusual level on
            the pins upon power-up then the BBB will not boot from
            the eMMC. So, a tri-state buffer is needed. The other reason
            is that there is a fair bit of capacitance and it is highly
            likely that the ADC may not be able to directly drive the
            pins at high speed. I actually came across this problem
            while trying to connect a camera to the BBB. I struggled for
            days without realising that the camera could not support
            the load. So, the buffers are likely to be essential for
            most designs using the pins that were selected. I used a
            74LVC244A device as a buffer. Note that the clock also needs
            a buffer, unless significant jitter is acceptable. No
            tri-state is required here, so I used a MC74VHC1GT50.

        LTC2315-12 
* Orange Pi Plus 2 : A nasty little thing
* BBB as always coming mostly from element14
        Some limits - not exploiting all ? http://exploringbeaglebone.com/chapter13/#The_ADS7883_Single-Channel_12-bit_ADC_1MSps_max
        SPI speed with BBB : http://fr.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/beagleboneio/ug/use-the-beaglebone-black-spi-interface-to-connect-to-a-device.html (up to 32MHz) - which is
* 16 bits : is it possible to set all 16 pins on pru0 as inputs? I saw you mentioned something about disabling the microSD functionality on the BB to get access to all 16 pins, but I wasn't exactly sure how. -- heartofasquid
        I thought the PRUs had a 16bit parallel capture mode or are all the pins not available on the BBB? (need to consult the docs) section 4.5.2.2.3.2 of the tech ref spruh73c.pdf One thought I had was to use both PRUs to capture alternate bytes/words but that was just a thought, again are all the pins available?
        I'd made a mistake, it looks like all of PRU0's GPI pins may be available, if we are happy to lose the microSD (no big loss - there are other ways to get data in/out of the BBB). So, we can theoretically get high-res captures up to about 15bits, if we need 1 pin for the clock.

Let's cut it to 500kHz ?

-   For headers, we have
    -   12 input pins on P8 for PRU1 and 1 input pin for PRU1 on P9,
        these have been assigned for 12bitADC+Clock and the rest,
    -   SPI for DAC,
    -   Buffer enable and motor control have been assigned to PRU0.
-   For the controls in prototyping:
    -   SW1 controls the gain range for TGC
    -   SW2 controls the input range of the ADC,
-   Updating the blog as well, integration of disqus

    -   1st and 2nd boards on their way.

1.  TODO: sign a release as soon as some code is on the way

### Jan 29th

-   http://semver.org/ for semantinc versionning of releases

### Feb 13th

-   Lots under way..

-   **Required**: we need to sit with electronics experts to check how
    Murgen, Tobo, Goblin, and Mira can merge - for a modular board -
    ideally as easy as possible to use!
-   IDEA: capelec!
-   Need also to push Goblin's files on the repo. Those are made with
    Eagle, not Altium, so a bit less options, but still interesting to
    see how to work with those files =)

### Feb 25th

-   Boards reached: issue with the 5V and GND - shortage

### Feb 26th

-   Further tests. Shortage still exists.
    -   Short is not on the PCB. Appears after solder.
-   Found that the RECOM component was designed to be upside down --
    need to resolder it. Luckily it was a via component.
    -   This would not be the source of the short anyhow.
    -   EF recommends that we burn 10A on the 5V plane to see which
        component would burn.. hmm i'm quite shy to do this :p
-   Documenting the issue on github.
-   Sending back boards to EF.

### Feb 28th

-   Starting the interim report.

### Feb 29th

-   Found the source of the short, ADL5511, 5V and GND inverted...
    -   TODO : amend the altium files to correct the ADL5511 and the
        RECOM tracks
-   TODO : sampling freq to be documented

### Mar 1st

### April 11th

Choice of a uC: "le boulot des microcontrollers, ce qui me gÃªne sur
l'espruino c'est le manque de sortie wifi - si on veut sortir des
donnÃ©es en wireless." Deux choix se profilent

-   WICED : STM32F205RG 120MHz ARM Cortex M3 MCU : 17 timers et 3 Ã
    12-bit, 0.5 Î¼s ADCs with up to 24 channels and up to 6 MSPS in
    triple interleaved mode, 8- to 14-bit parallel camera interface (48
    Mbyte/s max.)
-   Le WifiMCU : EMW3165 : M4: STM32F411CE @100MHz, DSP+FPU, 1Ã12-bit,
    2.4 MSPS A/D converter -- Ce qui me fait peur est un WifiMCU de base
    en LUA, a voir comment repasser sur du plus bas niveau. L'avantage
    par contre c'est qu'il est dispo chez hackspark, et coute 18â¬ au
    lieu des 35\$ du WICED =)

Remarques : Avec le M3 tu perds les instructions DSP et un FPU optionnel
(cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M). Par contre je ne sais
pas si c'est correctement exploitÃ©, ni si on en a vraiment besoin.

Il y a aussi le Module Particle "Photon"
http://www.lextronic.fr/P37394-module-particle-photon.html (M3 120 MHz
et wifi) ou l'Arietta
http://www.lextronic.fr/P32050-module-microcontrole-arietta-g25.html

-   Apparament module fermÃ©

### April 12th

-   WifiMCU ordered

c'est vrai que le WifiMCU est plutÃ´t tentant aussi. Faudrait passer un
peu de temps Ã  faire un mini comparatif de ces petites bÃªtes, voir les
benchmarker. On peut se faire une petite compÃ©tence autour des
STM32F4xxx (et leurs 800 pages de docs) avant de passer au FPGA?
